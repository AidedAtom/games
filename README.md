Theese are my games, here's how good i think they are(not that any1 asked):
  - buckshot.cpp - best project ive ever made. its most of the reason i made this github profile in the first place
  - testurluck.cpp - fun little project. probably worth playing once or twice its kinda fun ig but def not my greatest project
  - mini game.cpp - complete garbage, only posted it cuz its the first game ive ever made
To download go to "exe" branch
